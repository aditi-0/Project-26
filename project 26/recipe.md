 First cook 75 grams noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them. Adding noodles is optional and you can skip them. If skipping noodles, then begin from step 5.
 The noodles should be cooked well.
 Then drain the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.
 Drain very well and keep aside. From 75 grams of raw noodles, you will get about 1 cup cooked noodles.
 Chop the veggies in thin long strips. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper/capsicum in thin strips. French beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally. Chopping takes time, so you can also use a food processor to chop the veggies. please note you can use your choice of veggies.
 Now heat 2 tbsp sesame oil in a wok or kadai. Keep the flame on medium intensity and add ⅓ cup spring onion whites.
 Stir and then add all the veggies.
 Increase the flame to high and stir fry the veggies.
 Stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes on a high flame. The veggies need to have some crunch.
 Then add ½ tsp crushed black pepper or pepper powder. Also add 1 tsp finely chopped celery (optional).
Add 1 tbsp soy sauce. Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste. stir everything very well.
Then add the cooked noodles.
Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce already has salt.
Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
Switch off the flame and add 2 to 3 tbsp spring onion greens.
Stir and keep the filling aside. Let it cool down.
